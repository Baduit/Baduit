# Who am I ?
I'm a young french developper living in Nantes and working at GoPro.

My favourite programming langage is C++, well modern C++, because before C++11 a lot of things are really frustrating to do and when you have tried C++17, it is hard to use something older. Now that I have tasted C++20 I think I will never make any pet project in an older standard because it has so much new usefull features. 

Sometimes I also like to make little projects in javascript (with node.js) or python but I'm not as fluent in these langages as I am in C++.

Also I did some little stuff in C# but I can't really say I have experience in this langage.

And now I'm currently leanring Rust and I love it! I hope one day I'll have time to learn a bit of Ada.
