# Who am I ?
I'm a young french developper living in Nantes and working at [Elephant Technologies](https://www.elephant-technologies.fr/).

My favourite programming langage is C++, well modern C++, because before C++11 a lot of things are really frustrating to do and when you have tried C++17, it is hard to use something older. Now that I have tasted C++20 I think I will never make any pet project in an older standard because it has so much new usefull features. 

Sometimes I also like to make little projects in javascript (with node.js) or python but I'm not as fluent in these langages as I am in C++.

Also I did some little stuff in C# or in rust but I can't really say I have any experience in these langages.

# My favourite pet projects
* [Aggreget](https://github.com/Baduit/Aggreget): A C++20 header-only library to achieve non-intrusive compile time reflection on aggregate types. This my favorite because it uses advanced and recent functionnalities of C++ ([concepts](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constraints), [structure binding](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/structured_binding), [aggregate initialization](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/aggregate_initialization), [type traits](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/type_traits) and generic programming) but the code is still short and simple. Also writing this library was pretty straightforward.
* [ScriptGUIfier](https://github.com/Baduit/ScriptGUIfier): a generator of GUI for scripts, it is written in python. I initially developped it to manage my script on my pet projects and I ended up using it at work because thanks to it, it is easier to use and share my scripts with my colleagues to make our work easier and more productive.

# My articles (in french)
I have a blog made with Github pages and Jekyll: https://baduit.github.io/
